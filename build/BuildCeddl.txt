Preparation:
++++++++++++
1. Run docker
2. Check  Docker settings:
   - Shared drives: C and D, reset credentials after a password change.
   - Network: Choose fixed DNS server: 130.139.56.140
   - Proxies: No proxy

Execution:
++++++++++
Run .\build\BuildCEDDLLinux.bat

To check if libceddl.so is ok:
1. Modify BuildCEDDLLinux.bat:
   Comment out the lines at the end that do the cleanup (docker kill + rmi)
2. Run the script again from a powershell
3. To inspect the docker image: docker run -it philips/buildceddl bash
4. Go to /usr/ceddl/src
5. cp /usr/eddl/build/lib64/libeddl.so .  // Because else the contents of the library cannot be inspected
6. ldd libceddl.so
   This should results in no errors, all dependencies of the library should be found.

If there are problems or you want to update ceddl.c or ceddl.h
Prerequisite: Previous steps.
1. Checkout eddl archive: git clone https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl.git
    git checkout <tag> if you need a specific version
    Note: checking out eddl and opening in VSCode helps to inspect interfaces
2. Checkout ceddl archive: git clone https://github.com/deephealthproject/ceddl.git
3. Open ceddl archive in VSCode
4. Make changes
5. Run .\build\BuildCEDDLLinux.bat
