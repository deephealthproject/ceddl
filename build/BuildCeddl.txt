Preparation:
++++++++++++
1. Run docker
2. Check  Docker settings:
   - Shared drives: C and D, reset credentials after a password change.
   - Network: Choose fixed DNS server: 130.139.56.140
   - Proxies: No proxy

Execution:
++++++++++
1. Checkout ceddl archive: git clone https://github.com/deephealthproject/ceddl.git
2. Goto build directory
3. Execute .\BuildCEDDLLinux.bat from powershell

To check if libceddl.so is ok:
1. Modify BuildCEDDLLinux.bat:
   Comment out the lines at the end that do the cleanup (docker kill + rmi)
2. Run the script again from a powershell
3. To inspect the docker image: docker run -it philips/buildceddl bash
4. Go to /usr/ceddl/src
5. cp /usr/eddl/build/lib64/libeddl.so .  // Because else the contents of the library cannot be inspected
6. ldd libceddl.so
   This should results in no errors, all dependencies of the library should be found.

If you want to update ceddl with new functions it might be convenient to also clone the EDDL archive:
git clone https://github.com/deephealthproject/eddl.git

In case of issues with eddl there is a slack channel you can post questions to:
